The following is a list of phrases and formatting conventions typical of AI chatbots, such as ChatGPT.

Remember that not all text containing any of the phrases or formatting conventions listed below should be assumed to have been generated by AI chatbots; large language models have been trained on human writing, and humans on Wikipedia have also written like this. Even outside of identifying possible AI-generated text, many of these phrasings go against the Manual of Style, or even against the encyclopedic purpose of Wikipedia. Some words like "delve" are also common due to OpenAI outsourcing part of its training to workers in Nigeria, where "delve" is commonly used in business English.[1]

Language and tone
Undue emphasis on symbolism and importance
Words to watch: is/stands as/serves as a testament, plays a vital/significant role, underscores its importance, continues to captivate, leaves a lasting impact, watershed moment, key turning point ...

ChatGPT puffs up the importance of the subject matter with reminders that it represents or contributes to a broader topic. There seems to be only a small repertoire of ways that it writes these reminders, so if they are otherwise appropriate it would be best to reword them anyway.

Examples
... Douera enjoys close proximity to the capital city, Algiers, further enhancing its significance as a dynamic hub of activity and culture. With its coastal charm and convenient location, Douera captivates both residents and visitors alike, ...

— From this revision to Douéra
Promotional language
Words to watch: rich cultural heritage, rich history, breathtaking, must-visit, must-see, stunning natural beauty, enduring/lasting legacy, rich cultural tapestry ...

ChatGPT has serious problems keeping a neutral tone, especially when writing about something that could be considered "cultural heritage" – in which case it will constantly remind the reader that it is cultural heritage.

Examples
Nestled within the breathtaking region of Gonder in Ethiopia, Alamata Raya Kobo stands as a vibrant town with a rich cultural heritage and a significant place within the Amhara region. From its scenic landscapes to its historical landmarks, Alamata Raya Kobo offers visitors a fascinating glimpse into the diverse tapestry of Ethiopia. In this article, we will explore the unique characteristics that make Alamata Raya Kobo a town worth visiting and shed light on its significance within the Amhara region.

Editorializing

Words to watch: it's important to note/remember/consider, it is worth, no discussion would be complete without, in this article ...

This section is empty. You can help by adding to it.
Overuse of certain conjunctives

[icon]	
This section is empty. You can help by adding to it.
Collaborative communication
Words to watch: I hope this helps, Of course!, Certainly!, Would you like..., is there anything else, let me know, more detailed breakdown,  ...

In some cases, editors will paste text from ChatGPT that it had intended as correspondence, prewriting or advice for them, and not for direct use in an article.

Examples
In this section, we will discuss the background information related to the topic of the report. This will include a discussion of relevant literature, previous research, and any theoretical frameworks or concepts that underpin the study. The purpose is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter and to inform the reader about the existing knowledge and gaps in the field.

Summarization and concluding
Words to watch: In summary, In conclusion

ChatGPT will often summarize and restate the core idea of a paragraph/block at the end. While this works great for school essays, proper Wikipedia writing typically never summarizes the general idea of a block of text (outside of the lead section being a summary of the entire article).

Examples
In summary, the educational and training trajectory for nurse scientists typically involves a progression from a master's degree in nursing to a Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing, followed by postdoctoral training in nursing research. This structured pathway ensures that nurse scientists acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to engage in rigorous research and contribute meaningfully to the advancement of nursing science.

"Not" parallelisms
Parallel constructions such as "Not only ... but ..." or "It is not just about ..., it's ..." are common in AI writing but are often unsuitable for writing in a neutral tone.

Examples
Self-Portrait by Yayoi Kusama, executed in 2010 and currently preserved in the famous Uffizi Gallery in Florence, constitutes not only a work of self-representation, but a visual document of her obsessions, visual strategies and psychobiographical narratives.

It’s not just about the beat riding under the vocals; it’s part of the aggression and atmosphere.

— From this revision to Draft:Critikal! The Rapper
Born on January 24, 1889, in Senigallia, Marche, Italy, Eugenio Duse was the son of Luigi Duse and Cecilia Bellotti. He hailed from the esteemed Duse family, renowned for their theatrical legacy. Eugenio's life, however, took a path that intertwined both personal ambition and familial complexities.

Style
Title case in section headings
In section headings, AI chatbots tend to consistently capitalize all main words (title case) instead of using sentence case, as required by the corresponding style guideline.

Excessive use of boldface
AI chatbots may display various phrases in boldface for emphasis, which the style guideline on when not to use boldface recommends against in most cases (except for names of the article subject listed in the first sentence).

Lists
See also: MOS:USEPROSE
ChatGPT often organizes the contents of its responses into lists that are formatted in a particular way.

Lists that are copied and pasted from AI chatbot responses may retain their original formatting. Instead of proper wikitext, a bullet point in an unordered list may appear as a bullet character (•), hyphen (-), en dash (–), or similar character. Ordered lists (i.e. numbered lists) may use explicit numbers (such as 1.) instead of standard wikitext.

Examples
Ryan's World (formerly Ryan ToysReview) has been criticized for a number of reasons, particularly regarding advertising and child-directed content. Here are some highlights of the criticism:

Unclear advertising: One of the biggest issues facing Ryan's World is product promotion without a clear distinction between entertainment and advertising. Ryan's videos often include product reviews, especially of toys, which many say are not always clearly stated as advertising, which can be misleading to children. The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has asked the Kaji family to make adjustments and provide more clarity about the advertising in their videos.

Impact on Children: Some are concerned that advertising products through children's videos may influence young children's consumer behavior, leading to children being easily persuaded to buy toys or products they see on videos without understanding the purpose of the advertising.

Transparency: The channel has also been criticized for a lack of transparency in clarifying its agreements with brands, products, and marketing companies. Especially since some of the products advertised are not always the best or most valuable to consumers.

Despite this, the channel remains popular, and the Ryan family has taken steps to improve its compliance with advertising and child protection regulations in its videos.

Emoji
Sometimes, AI chatbots decorate section headings or bullet points by placing emojis in front of them.

Examples
Let’s decode exactly what’s happening here:
🧠 Cognitive Dissonance Pattern:
You’ve proven authorship, demonstrated originality, and introduced new frameworks, yet they’re defending a system that explicitly disallows recognition of originators unless a third party writes about them first.
[...]
🧱 Structural Gatekeeping:
Wikipedia policy favors:
[...]
🚨 Underlying Motivation:
Why would a human fight you on this?
[...]
🧭 What You’re Actually Dealing With:
This is not a debate about rules.
[...]

Spaced em dash
AI chatbots use the em dash (—) more frequently than most editors do, and may add a space before and after the dash. This differs from the style guideline on dashes, which states that em dashes should not be used with a space on either side, in contrast to the en dash (–) which should be spaced on both sides.

Examples
The term “Dutch Caribbean” is not used in the statute and is primarily promoted by Dutch institutions, not by the people of the autonomous countries themselves. In practice, many Dutch organizations and businesses use it for their own convenience, even placing it in addresses — e.g., “Curaçao, Dutch Caribbean” — but this only adds confusion internationally and erases national identity. You don’t say “Netherlands, Europe” as an address — yet this kind of mislabeling continues.

— From this revision to Talk:Dutch Caribbean
Curly quotation marks and apostrophes
Contrary to the style guideline on quotation characters, AI chatbots may use curly quotation marks (“...” or ‘...’) instead of straight quotation marks ("..." or '...'). In some cases, AI chatbots inconsistently use pairs of curly and straight quotation marks in the same response. Most keyboards only support straight quotation marks by default, and curly quotation marks are rarely manually typed.

Likewise, the apostrophe style guideline prescribes the use of the straight apostrophe (') instead of the curly apostrophe (’), which is the same character as the curly right single quotation mark. AI-generated text may use curly apostrophes in contractions and possessive forms, and may do so inconsistently.

Date format
In articles related to countries that primarily use DMY date format (such as India), addition of content with dates in MDY format is often an indicator of LLM use. Refer to List of date formats by country to determine the customary date format for the country associated with an article.

Accidental disclosure
Prompt refusal
Words to watch: as an AI language model, as a large language model, I'm sorry, as of my last knowledge update ...

Occasionally, ChatGPT will decline to answer a prompt as it is written, usually with an apology and a reminder that it is "an AI language model". Attempting to be as helpful as possible, it often gives suggestions or an answer to an alternative, similar request.

Although they may look obviously unacceptable for additions to a Wikipedia article, AI contributions do sometimes include prompt refusals. They might not have been reviewed by the human editor who pasted them in, or the editor might not have a proficient grasp on the English language. Remember to assume good faith, because the editor may genuinely be interested in improving the coverage of their region and is trying to help.

Examples
As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, I don't have specific information about the current status or developments related to the "Chester Mental Health Center" in today's era. However, I can provide you with some general information about mental health centers and how they typically function in modern times.

When results appear in these searches, they are almost always problematic – but remember that it would be okay for an article to include them if, for example, they were in a relevant, attributed quote.

"OpenAI use policy"
Phrasal templates
AI chatbots may generate responses with fill-in-the-blank phrasal templates (as seen in the game Mad Libs) for the LLM user to replace with words and phrases pertaining to their use case. When an LLM-using editor forgets to add the words, the result is obviously not written by the editor themself.

Examples
Subject: Concerns about Inaccurate Information

Dear Wikipedia

I am writing to express my deep concern about the spread of misinformation on your platform. Specifically, I am referring to the article about [Entertainer's Name], which I believe contains inaccurate and harmful information.

— From this revision to Talk:Kjersti Flaa
Markup
Use of Markdown
Some AI chatbots do not properly use wikitext in their outputs, and will instead use another markup language, most commonly Markdown. The presence of non-wikitext markup is a strong indicator that a section of text is LLM-generated.

Examples
See also: Markdown § Examples
I believe this block has become procedurally and substantively unsound. Despite repeatedly raising clear, policy-based concerns, every unblock request has been met with **summary rejection** — not based on specific diffs or policy violations, but instead on **speculation about motive**, assertions of being “unhelpful”, and a general impression that I am "not here to build an encyclopedia". No one has meaningfully addressed the fact that I have **not made disruptive edits**, **not engaged in edit warring**, and have consistently tried to **collaborate through talk page discussion**, citing policy and inviting clarification. Instead, I have encountered a pattern of dismissiveness from several administrators, where reasoned concerns about **in-text attribution of partisan or interpretive claims** have been brushed aside. Rather than engaging with my concerns, some editors have chosen to mock, speculate about my motives, or label my arguments "AI-generated" — without explaining how they are substantively flawed.

- The Wikipedia entry does not explicitly mention the "Cyberhero League" being recognized as a winner of the World Future Society's BetaLaunch Technology competition, as detailed in the interview with THE FUTURIST ([1](https://consciouscreativity.com/the-futurist-interview-with-dana-klisanin-creator-of-the-cyberhero-league/)). This recognition could be explicitly stated in the "Game design and media consulting" section.

turn0search0
ChatGPT may include citeturn0search0 at the ends of sentences, with the "search" number increasing as the text progresses. These are places where the chatbot links to an external site, but a human pasting the conversation into Wikipedia has that link converted into placeholder code.

A set of images in a response may also render as iturn0image0turn0image1turn0image4turn0image5.

This was first observed in February 2025, and was seen again in July 2025.

contentReference and oaicite
Due to a bug, ChatGPT may add code in the form of :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} in place of links to references in output text.

Examples
:contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}

- :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}
    * :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18} :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}.

Broken external links in citations
If a new article or draft has multiple citations with external links, and most of the external links are broken (error 404 pages), this is a sign of an AI-generated page.
