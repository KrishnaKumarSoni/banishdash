# Kleantype Refactor Summary

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished: Evidence-Based AI Text Humanizer

### ✅ **What Was Fixed**

#### **Architecture Problems Solved:**
- **5 AI calls → 1 AI call** (5x cost reduction, 5x speed improvement)
- **Complex parallel processing → Simple single-pass** (eliminated unnecessary complexity)  
- **Analysis-then-consolidation → Pre-process + AI + Post-process** (more efficient pipeline)
- **Stubborn retry logic → Smart constraint validation** (catches violations before they persist)

#### **Core Issues Addressed:**
- **Em dash persistence problem** - Multi-layer solution with pre/post processing safety nets
- **Curly quote normalization** - Deterministic character mapping
- **AI disclosure removal** - Regex-based pre-processing
- **Technical artifact cleanup** - Pattern matching for turn0search, contentReference, etc.
- **Promotional language** - AI-guided replacement with constraints

## 🏗️ **New Architecture**

```
Input Text → Pre-Process → AI Transform → Post-Process → Output
     ↓           ↓            ↓           ↓         ↓
   Raw AI    Fix Obvious   Single Call  Safety    Clean
   Content   Artifacts    Comprehensive  Net     Human Text
```

### **1. Pre-Processing Layer (`text_processor.py`)**
**Deterministic fixes for obvious AI artifacts:**
- Character normalization (em dashes, curly quotes)
- Technical artifact removal (turn0search, contentReference)
- AI disclosure phrase removal
- Collaborative phrase cleanup

### **2. AI Transformation**
**Single comprehensive call with strict constraints:**
- Engineering-optimized prompt with explicit examples
- Temperature control (0.1 → 0.05 for retries)
- Constraint violation detection
- Smart retry logic (max 2 attempts)

### **3. Post-Processing Safety Net**
**Catches stubborn AI violations:**
- Emergency dash fixes with context preservation
- Quote consistency enforcement
- Artifact cleanup fallback
- Intelligent sentence flow preservation
