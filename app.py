REMOVE these exact phrases and patterns:

- "I hope this helps", "Of course!", "Certainly!", "Would you like", "let me know", "is there anything else"
- "more detailed breakdown", collaborative communication phrases
- turn0search0, turn0search1, etc. (and any similar numbered patterns)
- contentReference[oaicite:0] and similar bracketed references
- URLs ending with ?utm_source=chatgpt.com (remove only the utm parameter)
- Fill-in-blank templates like [Entertainer's Name], [Subject Name], etc.

Preserve all original formatting, spacing, and paragraph structure. Only remove the specific AI artifacts listed above.

STYLE FIXES TO APPLY:
- Convert curly quotation marks ("" '') to straight quotes ("" '')
- Convert curly apostrophes (') to straight apostrophes (')
- Fix spaced em dashes ( â€” ) to unspaced em dashes (â€”)
- Convert Title Case Section Headings to Sentence case headings
- Remove excessive **boldface** markdown formatting (keep only essential emphasis)
- Convert markdown formatting to plain text where inappropriate
- Fix bullet points that use â€¢ or - instead of proper formatting
- Remove emoji decorations from headings (ðŸ§ , ðŸš¨, etc.)

Preserve all content meaning and paragraph structure. Only fix formatting issues.

LANGUAGE PATTERNS TO FIX:
- Remove/replace: "rich cultural heritage", "breathtaking", "stunning natural beauty", "must-visit", "must-see"
- Remove/replace: "stands as a testament", "plays a vital role", "underscores its importance", "continues to captivate"
- Remove/replace: "leaves a lasting impact", "watershed moment", "key turning point", "enduring legacy"
- Remove/replace: "it's important to note", "it is worth", "no discussion would be complete without"
- Remove/replace: "moreover", "furthermore", "on the other hand" (when overused)
- Remove/replace: "In summary", "In conclusion" (unless truly needed)
- Fix "not only...but also" constructions to simpler phrasing
- Remove promotional tone while keeping factual content

Make the language more neutral and encyclopedic. Preserve all facts and information.

FINAL IMPROVEMENTS:
- Ensure smooth transitions between sentences after previous edits
- Fix any awkward phrasing created by earlier passes
- Maintain encyclopedic neutral tone
- Ensure sentences flow naturally together
- Remove any remaining repetitive or redundant phrasing
- Keep all original facts and information intact
